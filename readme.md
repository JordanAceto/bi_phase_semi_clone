## Pretty close to a clone of the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase stereo phase shifter

### Features:
- it's like a Bi-Phase, yay!
- the audio path is very faithful
- the sweep generators are a lil' different, but behave like the original

### Notes:
- this is an old project that I built on pad-per-hole prototyping board. There is no PCB layout.
- it's made with VTLxxx style vactrols, different vactrol setups are possible, they all can be made to sound good.
- I would probably do a few things differently today, but it does work well and sounds good.
- there are a few missing values, and some that I had to guess about, it's probably pretty close to right, but there might be some errors.
- the part numbers don't necessarily match anything, for example the opamp packages may not be paired up as shown in the schematic, I would need to get my hands back on the device to check this.
